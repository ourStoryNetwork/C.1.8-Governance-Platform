## C.1.8.2.01-Agreements-Problem
### What problem is C.1.8.2 Agreements solving?
MSMEs don't have the resources to write effective Public Private Partnership agreements, so most of the community development in low income areas is carried out by private equity firms who don't have a vested interest in supporting the people and businesses in the area.
- Limited government staff and resources limits ability to focus on low income housing
- Uneccessary red tape make creating agreements unproductive
- Lack of transparency limits the creative freedom of the local community
